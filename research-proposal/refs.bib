	abstract = {Polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) is hailed as one of the foundational materials for microfluidics. Though a silicone-based elastomer of many desirable properties, the emergence of microfluidic fabrication techniques, especially soft lithography, has elevated its status to an exceptional one. In this mini review, we look at the salient aspects that make PDMS so special in achieving such a coveted status in the microfluidics community.

	abstract = {We used a boundary-integral algorithm to simulate drops passing through narrow pores, with three possible outcomes: passage without breaking, breakup due to contact with a bifurcation or corner, and breakup due to elongation. Smaller drops with low capillary numbers and high viscosities are more likely to go through the pores without breaking, larger drops are more prone to hit a pore bifurcation and break, and drops with large capillary numbers and same or lower viscosities than the bulk fluid are more likely to experience elongation and breakup. Pore geometry also has a strong effect, with relatively little breakup when there is no bifurcation. Finally, the post-pore size distribution of droplet sizes is relatively broad when the pre-pore size of the parent drops is large, but the post-pore size distribution is narrow for smaller parent drops (due to little or no breakup). These results may help guide emulsification processes.},

	abstract = {The motion of small droplets through microfluidic channels, membrane pores, and other confined geometries presents considerable computational challenge due to drop deformation, small clearances, and complex geometries. This paper addresses the challenge by developing a moving-frame boundary-integral method and demonstrating its utility with simulations of a three-dimensional, freely-suspended deformable drop moving through a T-shaped microchannel at small Reynolds number. The drop size is comparable to the channel height, which is much smaller than the channel depth. The drop is fed into a straight channel or arm of the T-junction, with prescribed flow ratio through the other two branches. This setup typically results in strong drop interaction with the furthest corner of the junction. For computational efficiency, the base flow in the channel without the drop is first determined. Then, a “moving-frame” or computational cell around the drop is dynamically generated, using the first solution to provide the fluid velocity on the cell boundary. This method is used to map the outcomes (movement into one branch or the other, or breakup and partitioning between the branches) as a function of the flow ratio between the two branches and the drop capillary number, size relative to the channel height, and viscosity ratio with the carrier fluid. A critical capillary number or size ratio is observed, below which the drop does not break. Above the critical value, the range of flow ratios over which impending breakup is predicted increases with increasing capillary number and size ratio. The volume partitioning in the range where breakup occurs is essentially unity for equal flow rates between the two branches, even though the geometry is asymmetric, and then the volume partition of the daughter drops favors the branch with higher flow rate and with a stronger dependence on the flow ratio for the smaller drop sizes and capillary numbers. The viscosity ratio has a small but noticeable effect, with drops of similar viscosity to the carrier fluid breaking most easily.},

The aim of this Review is to show the importance of these features in enabling new experiments in biology and chemistry. The recent advances in device fabrication are highlighted as are the remaining technological challenges. Examples are presented to show how compartmentalization, monodispersity, single-molecule sensitivity, and high throughput have been exploited in experiments that would have been extremely difficult outside the microfluidics platform.},

    abstract={Emulsions are present in multiple aspects of our everyday life, from food – mayonnaise, milk or vinaigrette -, to healthcare products – topical ointments or lotions -, to a broad variety of other products – ink, paints, insecticides, etc. An emulsion is a colloid of two or more immiscible liquids, where one liquid is dispersed in the form of drops in another liquid. The objective of the present dissertation is to describe the dynamics of the motion and deformation of those drops in narrow channels. Computational methods are developed and applied in different complex geometries that represent devices used in droplet microfluidics and emulsification. A moving-frame, boundary-integral algorithm is presented, which makes it possible to follow a three-dimensional viscous droplet travelling through two- and three-dimensional microchannels. The behavior of a droplet, including its deformation and breakup conditions, is studied when moving through a T-shaped channel, different constricted membrane pores, or a channel with finite depth (3D). The effect of the physical properties of the drop (i.e., size relative to the channel, capillary number and viscosity ratio with respect to the carrier fluid) on the different outcomes of each problem are studied, as well as the influence of the system characteristics (i.e. channel geometry, flow rates, depth). When placed in one of the lateral branches of a T-channel, the drop behavior is strongly affected by the volumetric flow ratio between the outlets, exiting the channel through the branch with a larger flow. For cases with a flow ratio not far from unity, when the drop hits the corner and reaches impending breakup, the size of each daughter drop is calculated. Breakup occurs more frequently for drops with larger size and capillary number. When a drop goes through a constricted pore, its fate is related to the pore geometry. Little to no breakup is observed in H (rectangular)- and circular-constricted pore networks, while drops always break (until they reach a critical size) in pores with Y-bifurcations. The drop motion varies depending on the nature of the channel where it is travelling. When a third dimension is added to the geometry (i.e. channel depth), the drop is affected by two competing effects: (1) the imposed flow is higher near the middle of a channel with lower depth, causing the drop to move faster, and (2) the front and back channel walls causes more viscous drag and slow down the drop motion, especially in the case of larger drops. Thus, the drop velocity is maximized for channels of intermediate depth. Finally, results obtained from experimental work are compared to the results obtained with the boundary-integral algorithm for a T-shaped channel and a cross-shaped channel. The algorithm is shown to successfully predict and reproduce the drop motion and deformation in the studied cases, especially in the simulations with three-dimensional channels.},
